# üî© AI Fastener Agent

An intelligent, conversational agent designed to streamline the process of identifying and matching fastener products. This application provides two primary functionalities:

1.  **Conversational Chat:** Engage with an AI assistant powered by the ultra-fast Groq LPU‚Ñ¢ Inference Engine for quick queries and product information.
2.  **Bulk RFQ Matching:** Upload an Excel file containing a list of customer product descriptions, and the agent will use a hybrid search approach (semantic + fuzzy) and an LLM to match them against a master product database.

This tool is built with **Streamlit** for the user interface and **Groq** for high-speed language model inference.
